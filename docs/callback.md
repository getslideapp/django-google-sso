# Get your Callback URI

The callback URL is the URL where Google will redirect the user after the authentication process. This URL must be
registered in your Google project.

---

## The Callback URI
The callback URI is composed of `{scheme}://{netloc}/{path}/`, where the _netloc_ is the domain name of your Django
project, and the _path_ is `/google_sso/callback/`. For example, if your Django project is hosted on
`https://myproject.com`, then the callback URL will be `https://myproject.com/google_sso/callback/`.

So, let's break each part of this URI:

### The scheme
The scheme is the protocol used to access the URL. It can be `http` or `https`. **Django-Google-SSO** will select the
same scheme used by the URL which shows to you the login page.

For example, if you are running locally, like `http://localhost:8000/accounts/login`, then the callback URL scheme
will be `http://`.

??? question "How about a Reverse-Proxy?"
    If you're running Django behind a reverse-proxy, please make sure you're passing the correct
    `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to the login request URL.

### The NetLoc
The NetLoc is the domain of your Django project. It can be a dns name, or an IP address, including the Port, if
needed. Some examples are: `example.com`, `localhost:8000`, `api.my-domain.com`, and so on. To find the correct netloc,
**Django-Google-SSO** will check, in that order:

- If settings contains the variable `GOOGLE_SSO_CALLBACK_DOMAIN`, it will use this value.
- If Sites Framework is active, it will use the domain field for the current site.
- The netloc found in the URL which shows to you the login page.

### The Path
The path is the path to the callback view. It will be always `/<path in urls.py>/callback/`.

Remember when you add this to the `urls.py`?

```python
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    # other urlpatterns...
    path(
        "google_sso/", include("django_google_sso.urls", namespace="django_google_sso")
    ),
]
```

The path starts with the `google_sso/` part. If you change this to `sso/` for example, your callback URL will change to
`https://myproject.com/sso/callback/`.

## Registering the URI

To register the callback URL, in your [Google project](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), add the callback URL in the
_**Authorized redirect URIs**_ field, clicking on button `Add URI`. Then add your full URL and click on `Save`.

!!! tip "Do not forget the trailing slash"
    Many errors on this step are caused by forgetting the trailing slash:

    * Good: `http://localhost:8000/google_sso/callback/`
    * Bad: `http://localhost:8000/google_sso/callback`

In the next step, we will configure **Django-Google-SSO** to auto create the Users.
