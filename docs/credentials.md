# Adding Google Credentials

To make the SSO work, we need to set up, in your Django project, the Google credentials needed to perform the
authentication.

---

## Getting Google Credentials

In your [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) navigate to _Api -> Credentials_ to access
the credentials your
for your all Google Cloud Projects.

!!! tip "Your first Google Cloud Project"
    If you don't have a Google Cloud Project, you can create one by clicking on the _**Create**_ button.

Then, you can select one of existing Web App Oauth 2.0 Client Ids in you Google project, or create a new one.

??? question "Do I need to create a new Oauth 2.0 Client Web App?"
    Normally you will have one credential per environment in your Django project. For example, if you have
    a _development_, _staging_ and _production_ environments, then you will have three credentials, one for each one.
    This mitigates the risk of exposing all your data in case of a security breach.

    If you decide to create a new one, please check https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/ for additional info.

When you open your Web App Client Id, please get the following information:

* The **Client ID**. This is something like `XXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com` and will be the `GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_ID` in
  your Django project.
* The **Client Secret Key**. This is a long string and will be the `GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET` in your Django project.
* The **Project ID**. This is the Project ID, you can get click on the Project Name, and will be
  the `GOOGLE_SSO_PROJECT_ID` in your Django project.

After that, add them in your `settings.py` file:

```python
# settings.py
GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_ID = "your client id here"
GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET = "your client secret here"
GOOGLE_SSO_PROJECT_ID = "your project id here"
```

!!! tip "Don't commit this info"
    Do not commit this info in your repository. This permits you to have different credentials for each environment and
    mitigates security breaches. That's why we are recommend you to use environment variables to store this info.
    To read this data, you will need to install a [Twelve-factor compatible](https://www.12factor.net/) library in your project.

    For example, you can use our sister project [stela](https://github.com/chrismaille/stela) to load the environment
    variables from a `.env` file, like this:

    ```dotenv
    # .env
    GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_ID="your client id here"
    GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET="your client secret here"
    GOOGLE_SSO_PROJECT_ID="your project id here"
    ```

    ```python
    # settings.py
    import os
    from stela import settings

    GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_ID = settings["GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_ID"]
    GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET = settings["GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET"]
    GOOGLE_SSO_PROJECT_ID = settings["GOOGLE_SSO_PROJECT_ID"]
    ```

    But in fact, you can use any library you want, like
    [django-environ](https://pypi.org/project/django-environ/), [django-constance](https://github.com/jazzband/django-constance),
    [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/), etc...

In the next step, we need to configure the authorized callback URI for your Django project.
